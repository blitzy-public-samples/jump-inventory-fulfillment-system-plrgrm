### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget. We have identified these risks and proposed mitigation strategies:

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Client requests additional features during development.
   - Mitigation: Clearly define project scope in the contract. Use change request process for any additions.

2. **API Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Unforeseen complexities in Shopify or Sendle API integrations.
   - Mitigation: Allocate additional buffer time for integration. Engage with API support early.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Risk: Additional time needed to meet performance requirements.
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing throughout development. Early identification of bottlenecks.

4. **Security Compliance**
   - Risk: Additional security measures required to meet industry standards.
   - Mitigation: Include security review in each development phase. Budget for potential security enhancements.

5. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Risk: AWS costs may exceed estimates due to higher than expected usage.
   - Mitigation: Implement AWS cost monitoring. Optimize resource usage regularly.
