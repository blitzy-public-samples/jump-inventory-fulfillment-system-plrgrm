# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will implement a robust authentication and authorization system using Google Cloud Identity Platform, ensuring secure access control and user management.

### Authentication

1. User Authentication Flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant GCIdentity as Google Cloud Identity Platform

    User->>Frontend: Enter credentials
    Frontend->>Backend: Send login request
    Backend->>GCIdentity: Verify credentials
    GCIdentity-->>Backend: Return authentication result
    Backend-->>Frontend: Send JWT token (if successful)
    Frontend->>User: Grant access or show error
```

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially for admin and high-privilege users.
   - Support SMS-based and authenticator app-based MFA options.

3. Password Policy:
   - Enforce strong password requirements (minimum 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
   - Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords.
   - Enforce password expiration every 90 days.

### Authorization

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | Full access to all system features and configurations |
| Warehouse Manager | Manage inventory, view reports, process orders |
| Warehouse Staff | Process orders, update inventory |
| Readonly User | View orders and inventory without modification rights |

2. Implement least privilege principle:
   - Users are granted the minimum level of access required for their role.
   - Regularly review and audit user permissions.

3. API Authorization:
   - Use OAuth 2.0 for Shopify API integration.
   - Implement API key authentication for Sendle API.

## DATA SECURITY

1. Encryption:
   - Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest in Google Cloud SQL.
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all data in transit.

2. Sensitive Data Handling:
   - Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) in Google Cloud Secret Manager.
   - Mask sensitive information in logs and user interfaces.

3. Data Access Controls:
   - Implement row-level security in PostgreSQL for multi-tenant data isolation.
   - Use Google Cloud IAM for managing access to cloud resources.

4. Data Retention and Deletion:
   - Implement automated data retention policies in compliance with regulations.
   - Securely delete data using industry-standard methods when required.

5. Backup and Recovery:
   - Implement daily encrypted backups of all data stored in Google Cloud Storage.
   - Regularly test data recovery procedures.

## SECURITY PROTOCOLS

1. Network Security:
   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) using Google Cloud Armor.
   - Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.
   - Enable HTTPS-only communication with valid SSL/TLS certificates.

2. Application Security:
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
   - Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
   - Regularly update all dependencies and libraries to their latest secure versions.

3. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Implement centralized logging using Google Cloud Logging.
   - Set up real-time security alerts for suspicious activities.
   - Use Google Cloud Security Command Center for threat detection and security analytics.

4. Incident Response Plan:
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan.
   - Conduct regular security drills and tabletop exercises.

5. Compliance and Auditing:
   - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
   - Maintain compliance with relevant standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).

6. API Security:
   - Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent API abuse.
   - Use API keys with short expiration times and rotate them regularly.

7. Frontend Security:
   - Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
   - Use React's built-in XSS protection and sanitize user inputs.

8. Backend Security:
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage.

9. Security Training:
   - Provide regular security awareness training for all team members.
   - Conduct code reviews with a focus on security best practices.

10. Third-Party Security:
    - Regularly assess and audit third-party integrations (Shopify, Sendle).
    - Implement sandbox environments for testing integrations.

By implementing these security considerations, the Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will maintain a robust security posture, protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure operations across all components of the system.
