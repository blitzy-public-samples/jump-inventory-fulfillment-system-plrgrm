2. Inventory Management:
   - Inventory levels are updated in real-time as orders are processed.
   - Barcode scans trigger inventory adjustments.
   - Bulk updates are processed asynchronously to avoid system overload.
   - Inventory changes are synced back to Shopify.

3. Shipping Label Generation:
   - When an order is ready for fulfillment, shipping details are sent to Sendle API.
   - Generated labels are stored in the database and associated with the order.
   - Tracking information is updated in Shopify.

4. Reporting and Analytics:
   - Aggregated data is processed nightly and stored in separate analytics tables.
   - Real-time reports use caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
